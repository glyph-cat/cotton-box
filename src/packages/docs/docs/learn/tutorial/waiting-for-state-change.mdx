# Waiting For State Change

Waiting is an observation strategy that utilizes `.watch` under the hood. It allows us to watch for state value changes until it matches a certain value or fulfils a certain condition then stops watching and returns a snapshot of that state.

Consider the code below, there are two things that we can do with it.
```js
const CounterState = new StateManager(0)

setInterval(() => {
  const randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * 100)
  CounterState.set(randomNumber)
}, 1000)
```

## Waiting for a specific value

We can pass a value to `.wait` and it will resolve when the state matches that value. The state is compared with the expected value using <ApiLink href={DocConstants.API_REFERENCE_URL_OBJECT_IS}>Object.is</ApiLink>.

In this example, the promise will resolve when the state equals to `42`.

```js
await CounterState.wait(42)
```

:::tip
The `.isInitializing` property of <ApiLink href={`${DocConstants.DOCS_API_CORE_URL}/StateManager`}>StateManager</ApiLink> and <ApiLink href={`${DocConstants.DOCS_API_CORE_URL}/AsyncStateManager`}>AsyncStateManager</ApiLink> can be used in a similar way to wait for initialization to complete (Example: `ExampleState.isInitializing.wait(false)`).
:::

## Waiting for a condition to be fulfilled
We can also pass a callback to `.wait` to fine tune the waiting behavior. The state snapshot will be passed to the function each time the state changes and the callback should return either `true` or `false`.

In this example, the promise will resolve when the state is a number that is divisible by 5.
```js
await CounterState.wait(state => state % 5 === 0)
```

<SimpleConsolePlayground code={CODE_EXAMPLE_EVALUATOR}/>

:::tip
When the condition is fulfilled, the `.wait` method returns a Promise that resolves into a snapshot of the state that fulfilled the condition. This is useful when we only know what condition to expect but not a specific value, as we could capture the value right after waiting.
