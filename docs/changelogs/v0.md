* Fixed incorrect type definition for `trySet`

### cotton-box-react
* N/A

## v0.10.0

### cotton-box
* Added `trySet` method to `SimpleFiniteStateManager`.
* Parameter `stateManagerName` of `InvalidStateTransitionError` has been renamed to `stateManager` for brevity.
* Constructor parameters of `InvalidStateTransitionError` (`fromState`, `toState`, `stateManager`) are now also available as public readonly properties.

### cotton-box-react
* N/A

## v0.9.0

### cotton-box
* Fixed a bug where `SimpleFiniteStateManager` would throw "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'has')" when setting state under certain circumstances.
* The constructor of `InvalidStateTransitionError` now accepts a third optional parameter `stateManagerName`.
* `Watcher.refresh` has now been renamed to `.post`. The `.refresh` method is still available but will be removed in a future version.

### cotton-box-react
* N/A

## v0.8.0

### cotton-box
* Added helper type `StateTransition`.

### cotton-box-react
* Updated type definitions for hooks to accept `SimpleFiniteStateManager` and `ReadonlyStateManager`.

## v0.7.0

### cotton-box
* Added `SimpleFiniteStateManager`, a sub-class of `SimpleStateManager` that only allows state change according to a set of predefined state transitions.

### cotton-box-react
* N/A

## v0.6.0

### cotton-box
* The `Equality` API has been removed — it now exists as a separate package: [`@glyph-cat/equality`](https://github.com/glyph-cat/swiss-army-knife/tree/main/src/packages/equality).

### cotton-box-react
* N/A

## v0.5.0

### cotton-box
* N/A

### cotton-box-react
* Updated post-install script.
* Removed Scope-related APIs (`StateManagerScopeProviderProps`, `StateManagerScopeProvider`, `useScoped`) to reduce complexity of the library.

## v0.4.0

### cotton-box
* The `Watcher` that Cotton Box uses internally is now exposed as a public API.
* Internal stability enhancements.

### cotton-box-react
* Internal stability enhancements.

## v0.3.0

### cotton-box
* Fixed incorrect export name for UMD builds.
* Events captured by `.watch` now includes `StateChangeEventType` as the second parameter.
* Events captured by `.wait` now includes `StateChangeEventType` as the third parameter.
* Type safety enhancements.
* Internal optimizations.

### cotton-box-react
* Fixed incorrect export name for UMD builds.
* Fixed a bug where error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')" would be thrown in production.
* Internal optimizations.

## v0.2.0

### cotton-box
* The `isInitializing` property of `StateManager` and `AsyncStateManager` is now exposed as a `ReadOnlyStateManager`.
* Removed method `.waitForInit` in favor of calling `….isInitializing.wait(false)` directly.
* State Managers without names will be assigned automatic names (`UnnamedStateManager_001`, `UnnamedStateManager_002`, and so on).

### cotton-box-react

`useInitState` has been removed in favor of a more direct way to find out if a State Manager is initializing:

```diff
- const isInitializing = useInitState(ExampleState)
+ const isInitializing = useSimpleStateValue(ExampleState.isInitializing)
```

The way `useInitState` works internally is also similar to calling `useSimpleStateValue`. By having one less hook means the codebase will have less complexity and becomes easier to maintain.

On top of that, now that `isInitializing` is exposed as a State Manager itself, this means it is also possible to watch for the changes and even use it with other UI libraries/frameworks such as Vue and Angular with significantly less friction.

## v0.1.0

### cotton-box
* The `wait` method now will only wait for the state to match or evaluator to return true, without checking if the state is currently initializing.
* Added new method `waitForInit` to `StateManager` and `AsyncStateManager`
* Added new method `reinitialize` to `StateManager` and `AsyncStateManager`
* `currentState` is now exposed in the `lifecycle.init` callback
* New property `isInitializing` exposed for `StateManager` and `AsyncStateManager`

### cotton-box-react
* Added new hook `useInitState`

## v0.0.2

### cotton-box
* Stability enhancements.

### cotton-box-react
* Passing `StateManager` and `AsyncStateManager` to `useSimpleStateValue` and `useSimpleStateValueWithReactiveSelector` will *not* cause an error to be thrown. This is the same behavior as v0.0.0. Instead, rely on TypeScript's type-checking to prevent passing the wrong State Manager type. This change is made to reduce some runtime overhead in the hooks by not having to validate the State Manager types.

## v0.0.1

### cotton-box
* Fixed a bug where the `didReset` lifecycle hook is called during initialization via `commit`.

### cotton-box-react
* Passing `StateManager` and `AsyncStateManager` to `useSimpleStateValue` and `useSimpleStateValueWithReactiveSelector` will now cause an error to be thrown.

## v0.0.0
* Initial release / pre-release
