# Opt Out of Re-renders Due To State Change

Occasionally, we might want to opt out of watching the state. This can be done by passing a third parameter. If we do not need to use a selector, we can pass `null` as the second parameter.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useStateValue } from '{:REACT_PACKAGE_NAME:}'

function App(): JSX.Element {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(true)
  const state = useStateValue(ExampleState, null, active)
  return '...'
}
```

The third parameter is a `boolean` flag that defaults to `true`. When set to `true`, the hook will observe state changes normally, when set to `false`, it will stop watching for state changes until it is set back to `true` again.

:::note
Setting the third parameter to `false` does not prevent the State Manager itself from changing state, but rather, it is just blocking the hook from watching for state changes.
